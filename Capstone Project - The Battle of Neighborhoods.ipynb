On the other are blue states & cities and liberals.  With so much discourse, it suggests a fractured country.  With that, my hypothesis is that the country is more similiar than different.  I intend to leverage data science and machine learning to validate or invalidate this hypothesis.\n\nI intend to analyze the venues that most often show up in the top liberal and conservative cities.  For this data, I'll leverage the FourSquare API.  From there, we can group together similiar cities (based on frequency of venues).  This may give us insight how political leanings may or may not interset with the types of businesses that show up in each respective area."

Unfortunately, the listing is an image, so I'll need to reconstruct manually into a table.\n2. I'll need geolocation data for the center point of each city.  I'm thinking of utilizing Nominatim to fetch this information.\n3. To get venue information, I plan to pull from the FourSquare API.  I'll use the geolocation information in #2 to pull the data for each city.  Specifically, I'll be utilizing the venues call in the API.  With that, sample data I'll get will include the category of the business - for example, yoga sudios, accessory stores, aiports, train stations, restaurants.  Features I'll be able to attract include frequency of categories.\n4. Once I've organized the venue information by frequency per city, I'll use K-Means to group together similar cities."
